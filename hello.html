<!-- This is the tutorial about GitHub.
It explains about how to use GitHub and the commands that could be stated
in it.
git add, git push, git pull, git commit -m "Commit-name"; used to save
state of file so as to be able to upload/download changes,
git commit -am "Commit-name"; this is the combination of add and commit
git log, git reset : git reset --hard <commit>; to reverse the version of
changes I have to the specified previous commit
git reset --hard origin/master; it reverses the version on your system back
to the default version of code which is on your GitHub repository, git status -->
