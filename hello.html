It explains about how to use GitHub and the commands that could be stated
in it.
git add, git push, git pull, git commit -m "Commit-name"; used to save
state of file so as to be able to upload/download changes,
git commit -am "Commit-name"; this is the combination of add and commit
git log, git reset : git reset --hard <commit>; to reverse the version of
changes I have to the specified previous commit
git reset --hard origin/master; it reverses the version on your system back
to the default version of code which is on your GitHub repository, git status
Branching: It means moving a part of a code to a sub-group in the main folder e.g style
But they're still the same file but has the changes you've made to each of them
until you merge those changes together.
git branch; helps to tell you what branch you are working on at that moment.
git checkout -b branch_name; it is used to checkout/create a new branch.
git checkout branch_name; it is used to swirch between branches
git merge branch_name; used to merge a branch being worked on with another branch
which has been specified when calling the command.-->
